# NearNeighbor Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement a NearNeighbor algorithm for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional data. The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a fundamental technique in data mining and machine learning, often used in applications such as recommendation systems, image retrieval, and clustering. For this project specifically, it take data from the waterloo website that contains node data for different countries and cities and orders the distance value for each node.

## Features
- Efficient implementation of the NearNeighbor algorithm.
- Support for high-dimensional data.

## Personal Findings
However, the time taken for the algorithm was significantly faster
than their optimal solution time taken. There were instances where the total distance was
extremely suboptimal in extreme cases like Japan, despite having 10k cities the total distance of
the tour was around 610K and the time taken is significantly shorter than the optimal time taken
